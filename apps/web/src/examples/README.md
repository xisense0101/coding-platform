# State Management Examples

This directory contains reference implementations and examples for the new state management architecture.

## Files

- `state-management-examples.tsx` - Comprehensive examples showing how to use React Query and Zustand

## Purpose

These examples are for **reference and learning purposes only**. They are not used in the actual application but serve as:

1. **Learning Resources** - Understand how to use the new patterns
2. **Copy-Paste Templates** - Quick starting points for new features
3. **Best Practices** - Demonstrating recommended approaches

## How to Use

1. **Read through the examples** to understand different patterns
2. **Copy relevant patterns** when implementing new features
3. **Adapt to your needs** - these are templates, not strict rules

## Examples Included

1. **Basic Query Usage** - Fetching and displaying data
2. **Mutation Usage** - Creating and updating data
3. **Zustand Store Usage** - Global state management
4. **Direct API Client** - Using the API client directly
5. **Request Cancellation** - Aborting ongoing requests
6. **Optimistic Updates** - Advanced UI update patterns
